# Nameless Engine (Still in search for a name)

Toy Engine in C++ for educational purposes.


## Goal

The goal here is to learn, to make decisions and understand why some are better than others. 
* To conceptualize and outline the engine's architecture.
* To understand how to separate the project into different layers (OS abstractions, Graphics abstractions, ...)


Since I am in college, I can only work at this during vacations.
For now, I'm creating a basic foundation so I can start to build on top of.

## TODO

I just created files and added them into the same folder, but it is starting to get messy. I'm thinking about creating another repository for just the os abstractions and add to this repository using 'git submodule'.

- [ ] Structure project using CMake
- [x] Create an abstract window class
- [ ] Create an abstract input class
- [ ] Create an abstract renderer class
- [ ] Fix CMake modules

Might edit these later.
